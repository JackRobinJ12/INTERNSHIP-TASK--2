**DESCRIPTION** :
This Java program is a simple weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for a user-specified city using the WeatherAPI.com service. It prompts the user to enter a city name, encodes the input to handle spaces, and constructs an API request URL using an API key. The program then sends an HTTP GET request to the weather API, retrieves the JSON response, and extracts relevant weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. Finally, it presents the weather information in a readable format, making it a convenient tool for checking live weather updates.
